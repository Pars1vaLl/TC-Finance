# Development Environment Setup Guide

## Prerequisites Installation

### 1. Install Node.js
1. Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version (recommended for most users)
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
4. Verify installation by opening a new terminal and running:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

### 2. Install Git (if not already installed)
1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download and install Git for Windows
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### 3. Install VS Code (recommended)
1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install VS Code
3. Install recommended extensions:
   - TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
   - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
   - Prettier - Code formatter
   - ESLint

## After Installation

Once Node.js is installed, we can proceed with the project setup. The next steps will be:

1. Initialize React project with Vite
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up PWA configuration
4. Configure TypeScript
5. Set up ESLint and Prettier

## Alternative: Manual Project Setup

If you prefer to set up the project manually without Node.js initially, I can create the basic project structure and configuration files for you to use later when Node.js is available.

**Note**: Node.js is required for this project as we're building a React application with modern tooling. The installation should take about 5-10 minutes.
